How to Import data into Willow from an S3 bucket
================================================

Willow has a rake task to facilitate the import of data from an S3 bucket. The files within the S3 bucket must be
grouped into separate folders, with one folder per repository object. Each repository object must have a metadata.json
file which conforms to the JISC RDSS metadata format.

An example S3 bucket structure might be:

  dir1/metadata.json
  dir1/file1.doc
  dir1/file2.pdf
  dir2/dir3/metadata.json
  dir2/dir3/file3.gif
  dir2/dir4/metadata.json
  dir2/dir4/file4.txt

In order to access the S3 bucket, Amazon keys (AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID and AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY) are required. The S3
importer must be run from within a Willow container. The access keys should be set as environmental variables within the
container.

The import is performed with the rake task willow:import. Two additional parameters are required: the AWS region of the
bucket and the bucket name itself.

For example, running from a development environment and creating a Willow container using docker-compose:

$ docker-compose run --rm -e AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=XXXX -e AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=XXXX willow bash

Then to perform the import of all items in the "test-importer-data" bucket in the "eu-west-2" region, we can run (within
the container):

$ rake willow:import["eu-west-2","test-importer-data"]



The importer takes a number of optional parameters specified via environmental variables. The INPUT_FILTER option allows
for a subset of items to be imported, e.g. IMPORT_FILTER=dir1/ will cause only the first repository object in the above
example (dir1/metadata.json, dir1/file1.doc, dir1/file2.pdf) to be imported. Whereas, IMPORT_FILTER=dir2/ will cause the
last two items to be imported (dir2/dir3/ and dir2/dir4/) and IMPORT_FILTER=dir2/dir3/ will cause only the middle item
to be imported (dir2/dir3/).

The optional parameters can be specified as part of the command line before the rake command, e.g.

$ IMPORT_FILTER=dir2/dir3 rake willow:import["eu-west-2","test-importer-data"]


Optional parameters include:

IMPORT_FOLDER: the location of a temporary folder to which items are downloaded prior to importing. Defaults to tmp/importer
IMPORT_FILTER: a filter to restrict which items get imported. Only files whose path matches the filter will be imported
IMPORT_USER: the email address of the user to which items should be loaded as, will default to Hyrax BATCH_USER if not specified
IMPORT_COLLECTION_ID: the id of the collection to which items should be loaded into
IMPORT_VISIBILITY: the visibility of the items being imported. Defaults to 'open'
